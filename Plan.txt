Problem:

key points
* coding competition between two teams
* there is always one winner/loser per contest
* there is never a tie
* winner = 3 points, loser = 0 points
* winner = team with has the most points
* an array of pairs representing competing teams - competition
* an array of ints containing the results - results
* array[0] = home team, array[1] = away team
* home team won = results = 1, away team won = results = 0
* maps behave like dictionaries in python

Plan:
1. create a map that takes key/value pair: key=string, value=int
2. setup solution by adding unique team names as keys and values to 0
3.
